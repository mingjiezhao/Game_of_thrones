# Game_of_thrones

Many people around me are fans of Game of Thrones and this fun project aims to analyze the words of the characters based on NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques.

In this project, four characters (Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Cersei Lannister) are picked for the analysis, because they said the most sentences. 

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) models are performed to see if there are some main topics from what they said. I also performed sentiment analysis on their words to see how they feel about by living in the fantastic world.
